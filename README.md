# A Visual Exploration of Greenhouse Gases(GHGs) in Washington State

## Overview

The project focuses on understanding the environmental impact of industrial activities in Washington state and exploring renewable energy trends. Using data from the Washington State Department of Ecology, we aim to achieve the following:

1. **Identifying Emission Sources:** We analyze greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data from 2012 to 2021 to identify major contributors, such as power plants, pulp and paper industries, petroleum systems, and suppliers.

2. **Renewable Energy Usage:** We delve into the consumption of renewable energy sources, particularly highlighting the dominance of hydropower and the rising adoption of solar power since 2012.

3. **Electricity Generation:** We investigate the types of fuels used for electricity generation in Washington, tracking changes over time, including the decline in hydroelectric power and the rise in natural gas usage.

The goal is to provide valuable insights into the state's environmental challenges and sustainable energy opportunities, aiding decision-makers and stakeholders in promoting a greener future.
